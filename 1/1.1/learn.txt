WHAT IS COMPONENTS?
Components are the independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JS functions , but work in isolation and return HTML or JSX to be very precised

it can be written as : -  every time we are working with component the only main thing which we have to keep in mind is to return an html comnponent 

function App(){
}
    OR 
const App = () =>{
    return <div>Components</div>
}


=> WHAT IS JSX?  jsx=javascript xml
JSX allows ys to write HTML in React
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React


=>RULE
1) anytime we are working with jsx then this is the first rule to keep in mind that from 1component we are only allowed to return 1 div 
and inside that div you can add many divs or other tags
2)in jsx we have to close every tags that we use
3)anytime you are working with classes you are not allowded to provide a class with class keyword instead of that you have to write className
4)anytime you are working with forms in such situations we have to provide 'htmlFor' instead of 'for' because 'for' keyword is preserved for javascript


=>{Expressions in JSX}
with JSX you can write Expressions inside curly braces. the Expressions can be a react variable, or property, or any other valid javascript Expression. Jsx will execute the expression and return the result.


=> Lists
In react, we will render listes with some type of loop. the javascript map() array method is generally the preferred method.
