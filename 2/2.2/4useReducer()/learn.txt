=>useReducer()
useReducer is a hook that is similar to usestate, but is designed for more complex state objects or state transitions that involves multiple sub-values. It allows you to manage state in a functional, Immutable way

syntax:-
const [state,dispatch] = useReducer(reducer,initialState)

initialState:-This is the startin value for the state when the component first renders
reducer:- This is a function that describes how the state should change based on actions. It takes the current state and an action as inputs, and returns a new state
state :- The current state value, which you can use in your component
dispatch :- A function you call to send actions to the reducer, which then updates the state.
